## FTP Storage

If you prefer using your own infrastructure you may set up Panda to store encoded files on FTP server.

### Setting up FTP with Panda

1.  Log in to your Panda account

2.  Click `Create new cloud` on your dashboard</br>
    In `Create new cloud` form select FTP Server as storage option

3.  Enter your credentials</br>
    Assuming you already have FTP account prepared, just enter host, port (default 21), username, pass and define folder where the files should be stored.


Your cloud with FTP storage is ready to use!
