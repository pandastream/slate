## Rackspace Cloud Files

Before storing original and encoded video files with Rackspace you should sign-up for an CloudFiles account if you don't have one yet.

### Create CloudFiles account

1.  Get RackSpace account</br>
    Go to [Cloud Files page](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/files/) and follow the sign-up process.
    
2.  Create container (optional)</br>
    Once signed in select Files in top menu and create container (either private or public).

2.  Grab your credentials</br>
    In your Cloud Control Panel you'll find your username and API key in Account Settings.

3.  Get your Temp URL token</br>
    You can either create Temp URL token yourself through API - [see how](http://docs.rackspace.com/files/api/v1/cf-devguide/content/Create_TempURL-d1a444.html) - or let us generate one for you while creating a new encoding cloud using Rackspace storage.</br>
    You can use the Temporary URL feature (TempURL) to create limited-time Internet addresses that allow limited access to your Cloud Files account. Using TempURL, you can allow others to retrieve objects from or place objects in your Cloud Files account for a specified amount of time. After the specified amount of time expires, access to the account with the TempURL is denied.

You are now ready to create a [Panda Cloud](https://app.pandastream.com/#/new) !

  <strong>Note:</strong>
   Panda will only store your credentials to let it's own user access the Cloud Files container.
